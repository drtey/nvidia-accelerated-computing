    "Accelerated computing is replacing CPU-only computing as best practice. The parade of breakthroughs driven by accelerated computing, the ever increasing demand for accelerated applications, programming conventions that ease writing them, and constant improvements in the hardware that supports them, are driving this inevitable transition.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the center of accelerated computing's success, both in terms of its impressive performance, and its ease of use, is the [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/about-cuda) compute platform. CUDA provides a coding paradigm that extends languages like C, C++, Python, and Fortran, to be capable of running accelerated, massively parallelized code on the world's most performant parallel processors: NVIDIA GPUs. CUDA accelerates applications drastically with little effort, has an ecosystem of highly optimized libraries for [DNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn), [BLAS](https://developer.nvidia.com/cublas), [graph analytics](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvgraph), [FFT](https://developer.nvidia.com/cufft), and more, and also ships with powerful [command line and visual profilers](https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-systems).\n",

    "  - The `__global__` keyword indicates that the following function will run on the GPU, and can be invoked **globally**, which in this context means either by the CPU, or, by the GPU.\n",
    "  - Often, code executed on the CPU is referred to as **host** code, and code running on the GPU is referred to as **device** code.\n",
    "  - Notice the return type `void`. It is required that functions defined with the `__global__` keyword return type `void`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`GPUFunction<<<1, 1>>>();`\n",
    "  - Typically, when calling a function to run on the GPU, we call this function a **kernel**, which is **launched**.\n",
    "  - When launching a kernel, we must provide an **execution configuration**, which is done by using the `<<< ... >>>` syntax just prior to passing the kernel any expected arguments.\n",
    "  - At a high level, execution configuration allows programmers to specify the **thread hierarchy** for a kernel launch, which defines the number of thread groupings (called **blocks**), as well as how many **threads** to execute in each block. Execution configuration will be explored at great length later in the lab, but for the time being, notice the kernel is launching with `1` block of threads (the first execution configuration argument) which contains `1` thread (the second configuration argument).\n",
    "\n",
    "`cudaDeviceSynchronize();`\n",
    "  - Unlike much C/C++ code, launching kernels is **asynchronous**: the CPU code will continue to execute *without waiting for the kernel launch to complete*.\n",
    "  - A call to `cudaDeviceSynchronize`, a function provided by the CUDA runtime, will cause the host (CPU) code to wait until the device (GPU) code completes, and only then resume execution on the CPU."

    "## Handling Block Configuration Mismatches to Number of Needed Threads\n",
    "\n",
    "It may be the case that an execution configuration cannot be expressed that will create the exact number of threads needed for parallelizing a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common example has to do with the desire to choose optimal block sizes. For example, due to GPU hardware traits, blocks that contain a number of threads that are a multiple of 32 are often desirable for performance benefits. Assuming that we wanted to launch blocks each containing 256 threads (a multiple of 32), and needed to run 1000 parallel tasks (a trivially small number for ease of explanation), then there is no number of blocks that would produce an exact total of 1000 threads in the grid, since there is no integer value 32 can be multiplied by to equal exactly 1000.\n",
    "\n",
    "This scenario can be easily addressed in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write an execution configuration that creates **more** threads than necessary to perform the allotted work.\n",
    "- Pass a value as an argument into the kernel (`N`) that represents to the total size of the data set to be processed, or the total threads that are needed to complete the work.\n",
    "- After calculating the thread's index within the grid (using `tid+bid*bdim`), check that this index does not exceed `N`, and only perform the pertinent work of the kernel if it does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of an idiomatic way to write an execution configuration when both `N` and the number of threads in a block are known, and an exact match between the number of threads in the grid and `N` cannot be guaranteed. It ensures that there are always at least as many threads as needed for `N`, and only 1 additional block's worth of threads extra, at most:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "// Assume `N` is known\n",
    "int N = 100000;\n",
    "\n",
    "// Assume we have a desire to set `threads_per_block` exactly to `256`\n",
    "size_t threads_per_block = 256;\n",
    "\n",
    "// Ensure there are at least `N` threads in the grid, but only 1 block's worth extra\n",

    "\n",
    "some_kernel<<<number_of_blocks, threads_per_block>>>(N);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the execution configuration above results in more threads in the grid than `N`, care will need to be taken inside of the `some_kernel` definition so that `some_kernel` does not attempt to access out of range data elements, when being executed by one of the \"extra\" threads:\n",

    "Either by choice, often to create the most performant execution configuration, or out of necessity, the number of threads in a grid may be smaller than the size of a data set. Consider an array with 1000 elements, and a grid with 250 threads (using trivial sizes here for ease of explanation). Here, each thread in the grid will need to be used 4 times. One common method to do this is to use a **grid-stride loop** within the kernel.\n",

    "In a grid-stride loop, each thread will calculate its unique index within the grid using `tid+bid*bdim`, perform its operation on the element at that index within the array, and then, add to its index the number of threads in the grid and repeat, until it is out of range of the array. For example, for a 500 element array and a 250 thread grid, the thread with index 20 in the grid would:\n",

    "- Perform its operation on element 20 of the 500 element array\n",
